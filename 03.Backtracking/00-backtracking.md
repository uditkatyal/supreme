The term backtracking implies - if the current solution is not suitable, then eliminate that and backtrack (go back) and check for other solutions.

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that considers searching in every possible combination for solving a computational problem.
It is known for solving problems recursively one step at a time and removing those solutions that that do not satisfy the problem constraints at any point of time.
It is a refined brute force approach that tries out all the possible solutions and chooses the best possible ones out of them.
The backtracking approach is generally used in the cases where there are possibilities of multiple solutions.

In any backtracking problems, the algorithm tries to find a path to the feasible solution which has some intermediary checkpoints. In case they donâ€™t lead to the feasible solution, the problem can backtrack from the checkpoints and take another path in search of the solution.
